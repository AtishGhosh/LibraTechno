    </ul>
    <h5>Why can we be trusted with their confidential data ?</h5>
    <h3>Protecting data on the PC:</h3>
    <div class="col-md-6" style="margin-bottom: 0;">
      <p>The data on a PC is important to the PC user and to the company. The data is often company confidential. It might be that the data is governed by government security or privacy regulations.</p>
      <p>Regulatory compliance usually includes dependencies on the use of encryption to protect the confidentiality of sensitive data. Our security can be part of your overall plan for regulatory compliance.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-6">
      <p>Another problem is protecting the availability of the data. All of us have accidentally damaged or destroyed data. Many of us have been the victims of malicious software, like a virus, that destroys data. One last point to think about. At
        the end of the life for a PC, what do you do to protect the confidentiality of data on a hard drive that is leaving the company? How do you be sure that your data won't be made available to the next person who owns that drive?</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Protecting data confidentiality:</h3>
    <div class="col-md-6" style="margin-bottom: 0;">
      <p>Our technology offers several layers of protection for confidential data. The first is the Hard Drive Password. If it is set, you have to provide it when the system is turned on, otherwise the drive will not spin up. If the drive does not
        spin up, then the data can not be accessed.</p>
      <p>Next on the list is encryption. The idea of data encryption sounds straight forward. If the data is encrypted, no one can use it.</p>
      <p>Our security offers two primary ways of protecting confidentiality of data on a PC using encryption. One is full hard drive encryption.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-6">
      <p>Every data sector on the hard drive is encrypted. That means that page data sets, swap files, temporary files, cached files from the internet and everything else is encrypted on the drive.</p>
      <p>The other approach is to encrypt files. File encryption means that the only data that is ever exposed to an attacker is data that happens to be decrypted and in use at the time the attacker gains access to the PC.</p>
      <p>Both ways of protecting the confidentiality of your data rely on authentication to prove you have the right to access that data. Access can be granted if you know the password or if your fingerprint is a match.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Data Regulatory Compliance:</h3>
    <div class="col-md-6" style="margin-bottom: 0;">
      <p>The need to protect data stored and accessed through PCs has never been greater, and new and existing government regulations make it even more important and risky.</p>
      <p>Protecting the availability of data on a PC: Data can be lost by accident, equipment failure and by malicious software. Measures can be taken to reduce the chance of loss, including user education and software that blocks malicious software.
        No matter what is done to prevent loss, sometimes it happens. That is why we make backups.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-6">
      <p>Our technology follows two strategies for helping you to protect the availability of your data. One strategy is to help you block malicious software. This strategy includes Antidote emergency patch management. Antidote provides a service
        unique in the industry. It makes it possible for you to patch a system that has already been destroyed by malicious software.</p>
      <p>The other approach is to provide a robust and flexible PC backup and recovery solution. This solution enables you to recover all or part of the data on your PC, even if the operating system won't boot.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Protect against harmful virus attacks:</h3>
    <p>Preloaded Norton AntiVirus (OEM Version) software by SymantecT (select models) examines memory, boot records and system files and helps defend our system from software viruses without interrupting your work. The preload includes 90 days of
      virus definition updates.</p>
    <h3>Protecting the confidentiality of data on drives that are at end of life:</h3>
    <p class="col-md-6" style="margin-bottom: 0;">You have had this disk drive for three years. During that time, you've written a lot of confidential information on the drive. Now it is time for that drive to go away. Where will it go? Who will
      receive it? Most important of all, what will they find on that drive when they receive it?</p>
    <p class="col-md-6">The only correct answer to that question is â€” nothing. Destroying drive data at PC end of life. Secure Data Disposal should be the last program run on a PC before that PC is sent out of the company. The purpose of the product
      is to permanently remove all traces of data previously stored on the hard drive.</p>
